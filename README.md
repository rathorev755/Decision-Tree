penguins_size.csv: Simplified data from original penguin data sets. Contains variables:

species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g: body mass (g)
island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
sex: penguin sex
(Not used) penguins_lter.csv: Original combined data for 3 penguin species

Note: The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak"
